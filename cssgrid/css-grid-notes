compare it to what it is most similar to which is flexbox.  

flexbox is a way to layout things in one dimension 

grid is exactly the same that you can lay out the items in two dimensions
NOT just one dimension

ok so css grid looks like there is just more dimensions to it than flexbox... flexbox is more for doing the nav layout or something and css grid is for the grid

container is the square that wraps all the different things inside of the grid.  

you can have grid gaps in between the items.  

same as flexbox you have to set the display property




display: grid

what to make it to make it an actual grid 
you need to define

grid-template-columns: <<SPECS HERE>>

you can use any size that is acceptable in css ie rems percentages px etc

grid-template-columns: 200px 100px;

you can use the fraction unit using fr.... fraction unit...

2fr will be twice as much space taken up as 1 fr.  

REPEAT

you can use the repeat you can have 4 columns

just use the repeat command

that is really huge for the project... i mean we have 16 divs and at the start we were going to write out all of them.... 

CODE
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 100px);
